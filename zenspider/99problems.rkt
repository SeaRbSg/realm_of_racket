;;   Based on a Prolog problem list by werner.hett@hti.bfh.ch
;;
;; Working with lists
;;
;;    [1]P01 (*) Find the last box of a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (my-last '(a b c d))
;;           (D)

(define (my-last l)
  (if (or (empty? l) (empty? (rest l)))
      l
      (my-last (rest l))))

(check-equal? '()  (my-last '()))
(check-equal? '(a) (my-last '(a)))
(check-equal? '(d) (my-last '(a b c d)))

;;    [2]P02 (*) Find the last but one box of a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (my-but-last '(a b c d))
;;           (C D)

(define (my-but-last l)
  (if (or (empty? l) (empty? (rest l)) (empty? (rest (rest l))))
      l
      (my-but-last (rest l))))

(check-equal? '()    (my-but-last '()))
(check-equal? '(a)   (my-but-last '(a)))
(check-equal? '(a b) (my-but-last '(a b)))
(check-equal? '(c d) (my-but-last '(a b c d)))

;;    [3]P03 (*) Find the K'th element of a list.
;;           The first element in the list is number 1.
;;           Example:
;;           * (element-at '(a b c d e) 3)
;;           C

(define (element-at1 l n)
  (if (and (pair? l) (list? l))
      (if (= 1 n)
          (first l)
          (element-at (rest l) (sub1 n)))

(define (element-at2 l n)
  (unless (and (pair? l) (list? l))
      (raise-argument-error 'element-at "(and/c list? (not/c empty?))" l))
  (if (= 1 n)
      (first l)
      (element-at (rest l) (sub1 n))))

(define (element-at l n)
  (if (= 1 n)
      (first l) ; exception handled by contract in first
      (element-at (rest l) (sub1 n))))

(check-equal? 'a           (element-at '(a b c d e) 1))
(check-equal? 'c           (element-at '(a b c d e) 3))
(check-exn exn:fail? (Î» () (element-at '(a b c d e) 6)))

;;    [4]P04 (*) Find the number of elements of a list.

(define (list-size l)
  (if (empty? l)
      0
      (add1 (list-size (rest l)))))

(check-equal? 0 (list-size empty))
(check-equal? 1 (list-size '(a)))
(check-equal? 5 (list-size '(a b c d e)))

;;    [5]P05 (*) Reverse a list.

(define (reverse-list l)
  (if (empty? l)
      l
      (append (reverse-list (rest l)) (list (first l))))) ; cheating?

(check-equal? '()          (reverse-list '()))
(check-equal? '(a)         (reverse-list '(a)))
(check-equal? '(e d c b a) (reverse-list '(a b c d e)))

;;    [6]P06 (*) Find out whether a list is a palindrome.
;;           A palindrome can be read forward or backward; e.g. (x a m a x).

(define (palindrome? l)
  (equal? l (reverse-list l)))

(check-true  (palindrome? '()))
(check-true  (palindrome? '(a)))
(check-true  (palindrome? '(a b a)))
(check-false (palindrome? '(a b)))

;;    [7]P07 (**) Flatten a nested list structure.
;;           Transform a list, possibly holding lists as elements into a
;;           `flat' list by replacing each list with its elements
;;           (recursively).
;;           Example:
;;           * (my-flatten '(a (b (c d) e)))
;;           (A B C D E)
;;           Hint: Use the predefined functions list and append.
;;
;;    [8]P08 (**) Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.
;;           If a list contains repeated elements they should be replaced
;;           with a single copy of the element. The order of the elements
;;           should not be changed.
;;           Example:
;;           * (compress '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;;           (A B C A D E)
;;
;;    [9]P09 (**) Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.
;;           If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in
;;           separate sublists.
;;           Example:
;;           * (pack '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;;           ((A A A A) (B) (C C) (A A) (D) (E E E E))
;;
;;    [10]P10 (*) Run-length encoding of a list.
;;           Use the result of problem P09 to implement the so-called
;;           run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive
;;           duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the
;;           number of duplicates of the element E.
;;           Example:
;;           * (encode '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;;           ((4 A) (1 B) (2 C) (2 A) (1 D)(4 E))
;;
;;    [11]P11 (*) Modified run-length encoding.
;;           Modify the result of problem P10 in such a way that if an
;;           element has no duplicates it is simply copied into the result
;;           list. Only elements with duplicates are transferred as (N E)
;;           lists.
;;           Example:
;;           * (encode-modified '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;;           ((4 A) B (2 C) (2 A) D (4 E))
;;
;;    [12]P12 (**) Decode a run-length encoded list.
;;           Given a run-length code list generated as specified in problem
;;           P11. Construct its uncompressed version.
;;
;;    [13]P13 (**) Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution).
;;           Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression
;;           method directly. I.e. don't explicitly create the sublists
;;           containing the duplicates, as in problem P09, but only count
;;           them. As in problem P11, simplify the result list by replacing
;;           the singleton lists (1 X) by X.
;;           Example:
;;           * (encode-direct '(a a a a b c c a a d e e e e))
;;           ((4 A) B (2 C) (2 A) D (4 E))
;;
;;    [14]P14 (*) Duplicate the elements of a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (dupli '(a b c c d))
;;           (A A B B C C C C D D)
;;
;;    [15]P15 (**) Replicate the elements of a list a given number of times.
;;           Example:
;;           * (repli '(a b c) 3)
;;           (A A A B B B C C C)
;;
;;    [16]P16 (**) Drop every N'th element from a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (drop '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3)
;;           (A B D E G H K)
;;
;;    [17]P17 (*) Split a list into two parts; the length of the first part
;;           is given.
;;           Do not use any predefined predicates.
;;           Example:
;;           * (split '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3)
;;           ( (A B C) (D E F G H I K))
;;
;;    [18]P18 (**) Extract a slice from a list.
;;           Given two indices, I and K, the slice is the list containing the
;;           elements between the I'th and K'th element of the original list
;;           (both limits included). Start counting the elements with 1.
;;           Example:
;;           * (slice '(a b c d e f g h i k) 3 7)
;;           (C D E F G)
;;
;;    [19]P19 (**) Rotate a list N places to the left.
;;           Examples:
;;           * (rotate '(a b c d e f g h) 3)
;;           (D E F G H A B C)
;;           * (rotate '(a b c d e f g h) -2)
;;           (G H A B C D E F)
;;           Hint: Use the predefined functions length and append, as well as
;;           the result of problem P17.
;;
;;    [20]P20 (*) Remove the K'th element from a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (remove-at '(a b c d) 2)
;;           (A C D)
;;
;;    [21]P21 (*) Insert an element at a given position into a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (insert-at 'alfa '(a b c d) 2)
;;           (A ALFA B C D)
;;
;;    [22]P22 (*) Create a list containing all integers within a given range.
;;           If first argument is smaller than second, produce a list in
;;           decreasing order.
;;           Example:
;;           * (range 4 9)
;;           (4 5 6 7 8 9)
;;
;;    [23]P23 (**) Extract a given number of randomly selected elements from
;;           a list.
;;           The selected items shall be returned in a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (rnd-select '(a b c d e f g h) 3)
;;           (E D A)
;;           Hint: Use the built-in random number generator and the result of
;;           problem P20.
;;
;;    [24]P24 (*) Lotto: Draw N different random numbers from the set 1..M.
;;           The selected numbers shall be returned in a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (lotto-select 6 49)
;;           (23 1 17 33 21 37)
;;           Hint: Combine the solutions of problems P22 and P23.
;;
;;    [25]P25 (*) Generate a random permutation of the elements of a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (rnd-permu '(a b c d e f))
;;           (B A D C E F)
;;           Hint: Use the solution of problem P23.
;;
;;    [26]P26 (**) Generate the combinations of K distinct objects chosen
;;           from the N elements of a list
;;           In how many ways can a committee of 3 be chosen from a group of
;;           12 people? We all know that there are C(12,3) = 220
;;           possibilities (C(N,K) denotes the well-known binomial
;;           coefficients). For pure mathematicians, this result may be
;;           great. But we want to really generate all the possibilities in a
;;           list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (combination 3 '(a b c d e f))
;;           ((A B C) (A B D) (A B E) ... )
;;
;;    [27]P27 (**) Group the elements of a set into disjoint subsets.
;;           a) In how many ways can a group of 9 people work in 3 disjoint
;;           subgroups of 2, 3 and 4 persons? Write a function that generates
;;           all the possibilities and returns them in a list.
;;           Example:
;;           * (group3 '(aldo beat carla david evi flip gary hugo ida))
;;           ( ( (ALDO BEAT) (CARLA DAVID EVI) (FLIP GARY HUGO IDA) )
;;           ... )
;;           b) Generalize the above predicate in a way that we can specify a
;;           list of group sizes and the predicate will return a list of
;;           groups.
;;           Example:
;;           * (group '(aldo beat carla david evi flip gary hugo ida) '(2 2
;;           5))
;;           ( ( (ALDO BEAT) (CARLA DAVID) (EVI FLIP GARY HUGO IDA) )
;;           ... )
;;           Note that we do not want permutations of the group members; i.e.
;;           ((ALDO BEAT) ...) is the same solution as ((BEAT ALDO) ...).
;;           However, we make a difference between ((ALDO BEAT) (CARLA DAVID)
;;           ...) and ((CARLA DAVID) (ALDO BEAT) ...).
;;           You may find more about this combinatorial problem in a good
;;           book on discrete mathematics under the term "multinomial
;;           coefficients".
;;
;;    [28]P28 (**) Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists
;;           a) We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists
;;           themselves. The objective is to sort the elements of this list
;;           according to their length. E.g. short lists first, longer lists
;;           later, or vice versa.
;;           Example:
;;           * (lsort '((a b c) (d e) (f g h) (d e) (i j k l) (m n) (o)))
;;           ((O) (D E) (D E) (M N) (A B C) (F G H) (I J K L))
;;           b) Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are
;;           lists themselves. But this time the objective is to sort the
;;           elements of this list according to their length frequency; i.e.,
;;           in the default, where sorting is done ascendingly, lists with
;;           rare lengths are placed first, others with a more frequent
;;           length come later.
;;           Example:
;;           * (lfsort '((a b c) (d e) (f g h) (d e) (i j k l) (m n) (o)))
;;           ((i j k l) (o) (a b c) (f g h) (d e) (d e) (m n))
;;           Note that in the above example, the first two lists in the
;;           result have length 4 and 1, both lengths appear just once. The
;;           third and forth list have length 3 which appears twice (there
;;           are two list of this length). And finally, the last three lists
;;           have length 2. This is the most frequent length.
;;
;; Arithmetic
;;
;;    [29]P31 (**) Determine whether a given integer number is prime.
;;           Example:
;;           * (is-prime 7)
;;           T
;;
;;    [30]P32 (**) Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive
;;           integer numbers.
;;           Use Euclid's algorithm.
;;           Example:
;;           * (gcd 36 63)
;;           9
;;
;;    [31]P33 (*) Determine whether two positive integer numbers are coprime.
;;           Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals
;;           1.
;;           Example:
;;           * (coprime 35 64)
;;           T
;;
;;    [32]P34 (**) Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).
;;           Euler's so-called totient function phi(m) is defined as the
;;           number of positive integers r (1 <= r < m) that are coprime to
;;           m.
;;
;;           Example: m = 10: r = 1,3,7,9; thus phi(m) = 4. Note the special
;;           case: phi(1) = 1.
;;
;;           * (totient-phi 10)
;;           4
;;
;;           Find out what the value of phi(m) is if m is a prime number.
;;           Euler's totient function plays an important role in one of the
;;           most widely used public key cryptography methods (RSA). In this
;;           exercise you should use the most primitive method to calculate
;;           this function (there are smarter ways that we shall discuss
;;           later).
;;
;;    [33]P35 (**) Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer.
;;           Construct a flat list containing the prime factors in ascending
;;           order.
;;           Example:
;;           * (prime-factors 315)
;;           (3 3 5 7)
;;
;;    [34]P36 (**) Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer
;;           (2).
;;           Construct a list containing the prime factors and their
;;           multiplicity.
;;           Example:
;;           * (prime-factors-mult 315)
;;           ((3 2) (5 1) (7 1))
;;
;;           Hint: The problem is similar to problem [35]P13.
;;
;;    [36]P37 (**) Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).
;;           See problem P34 for the definition of Euler's totient function.
;;           If the list of the prime factors of a number m is known in the
;;           form of problem P36 then the function phi(m) can be efficiently
;;           calculated as follows: Let ((p1 m1) (p2 m2) (p3 m3) ...) be the
;;           list of prime factors (and their multiplicities) of a given
;;           number m. Then phi(m) can be calculated with the following
;;           formula:
;;
;;           phi(m) = (p1 - 1) * p1 ** (m1 - 1) + (p2 - 1) * p2 ** (m2 - 1) +
;;           (p3 - 1) * p3 ** (m3 - 1) + ...
;;
;;           Note that a ** b stands for the b'th power of a.
;;
;;    [37]P38 (*) Compare the two methods of calculating Euler's totient
;;           function.
;;           Use the solutions of problems P34 and P37 to compare the
;;           algorithms. Take the number of logical inferences as a measure
;;           for efficiency. Try to calculate phi(10090) as an example.
;;
;;    [38]P39 (*) A list of prime numbers.
;;           Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit,
;;           construct a list of all prime numbers in that range.
;;
;;    [39]P40 (**) Goldbach's conjecture.
;;           Goldbach's conjecture says that every positive even number
;;           greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers. Example: 28 = 5
;;           + 23. It is one of the most famous facts in number theory that
;;           has not been proved to be correct in the general case. It has
;;           been numerically confirmed up to very large numbers (much larger
;;           than we can go with our Prolog system). Write a predicate to
;;           find the two prime numbers that sum up to a given even integer.
;;
;;           Example:
;;           * (goldbach 28)
;;           (5 23)
;;
;;    [40]P41 (**) A list of Goldbach compositions.
;;           Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print a
;;           list of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.
;;
;;           Example:
;;           * (goldbach-list 9 20)
;;           10 = 3 + 7
;;           12 = 5 + 7
;;           14 = 3 + 11
;;           16 = 3 + 13
;;           18 = 5 + 13
;;           20 = 3 + 17
;;
;;           In most cases, if an even number is written as the sum of two
;;           prime numbers, one of them is very small. Very rarely, the
;;           primes are both bigger than say 50. Try to find out how many
;;           such cases there are in the range 2..3000.
;;
;;           Example (for a print limit of 50):
;;           * (goldbach-list 1 2000 50)
;;           992 = 73 + 919
;;           1382 = 61 + 1321
;;           1856 = 67 + 1789
;;           1928 = 61 + 1867
;;
;; Logic and Codes
;;
;;    [41]P46 (**) Truth tables for logical expressions.
;;           Define predicates and/2, or/2, nand/2, nor/2, xor/2, impl/2 and
;;           equ/2 (for logical equivalence) which succeed or fail according
;;           to the result of their respective operations; e.g. and(A,B) will
;;           succeed, if and only if both A and B succeed. Note that A and B
;;           can be Prolog goals (not only the constants true and fail).

;;           from 1 at the root). In level H, which may contain less than the
;;           maximum possible number of nodes, all the nodes are
;;           "left-adjusted". This means that in a levelorder tree traversal
;;           all internal nodes come first, the leaves come second, and empty
;;           successors (the nil's which are not really nodes!) come last.
;;           Particularly, complete binary trees are used as data structures
;;           (or addressing schemes) for heaps.
;;           We can assign an address number to each node in a complete
;;           binary tree by enumerating the nodes in levelorder, starting at

;;           afg^^c^bd^e^^^
;;           Define the syntax of the string and write a predicate
;;           tree(String,Tree) to construct the Tree when the String is
;;           given. Work with atoms (instead of strings). Make your predicate
;;           work in both directions.

;;    [74]P71 (*) Determine the internal path length of a tree
;;           We define the internal path length of a multiway tree as the
;;           total sum of the path lengths from the root to all nodes of the
;;           tree. By this definition, the tree in the figure of problem P70
;;           has an internal path length of 9. Write a predicate
;;           ipl(Tree,IPL) for the flow pattern (+,-).
;;
;;    [75]P72 (*) Construct the bottom-up order sequence of the tree nodes
;;           Write a predicate bottom-up(Tree,Seq) which constructs the
;;           bottom-up sequence of the nodes of the multiway tree Tree. Seq
;;           should be a Prolog list. What happens if you run your predicate
;;           backwords?
;;
;;    [76]P73 (**) Lisp-like tree representation
;;           There is a particular notation for multiway trees in Lisp. Lisp
;;           is a prominent functional programming language, which is used
;;           primarily for artificial intelligence problems. As such it is
;;           one of the main competitors of Prolog. In Lisp almost everything
;;           is a list, just as in Prolog everything is a term.
;;           The following pictures show how multiway tree structures are
;;           represented in Lisp.
;;           [p73.png]
;;           Note that in the "lispy" notation a node with successors
;;           (children) in the tree is always the first element in a list,
;;           followed by its children. The "lispy" representation of a
;;           multiway tree is a sequence of atoms and parentheses '(' and
;;           ')', which we shall collectively call "tokens". We can represent
;;           this sequence of tokens as a Prolog list; e.g. the lispy
;;           expression (a (b c)) could be represented as the Prolog list
;;           ['(', a, '(', b, c, ')', ')']. Write a predicate tree-ltl(T,LTL)
;;           which constructs the "lispy token list" LTL if the tree is given
;;           as term T in the usual Prolog notation.
;;           Example:
;;           * tree-ltl(t(a,[t(b,[]),t(c,[])]),LTL).
;;           LTL = ['(', a, '(', b, c, ')', ')']
;;
;;           As a second, even more interesting exercise try to rewrite
;;           tree-ltl/2 in a way that the inverse conversion is also
;;           possible: Given the list LTL, construct the Prolog tree T. Use
;;           difference lists.
;;
;; Graphs
;;
;;    A graph is defined as a set of nodes and a set of edges, where each
;;    edge is a pair of nodes.
;;
;;    There are several ways to represent graphs in Prolog. One method is to
;;    represent each edge separately as one clause (fact). In this form, the
;;    graph depicted below is represented as the following predicate:
;;    [graph1.gif]
;; edge(h,g).
;; edge(k,f).
;; edge(f,b).
;; ...
;;
;;    We call this edge-clause form. Obviously, isolated nodes cannot be
;;    represented. Another method is to represent the whole graph as one data
;;    object. According to the definition of the graph as a pair of two sets
;;    (nodes and edges), we may use the following Prolog term to represent
;;    the example graph:
;; graph([b,c,d,f,g,h,k],[e(b,c),e(b,f),e(c,f),e(f,k),e(g,h)])
;;
;;    We call this graph-term form. Note, that the lists are kept sorted,
;;    they are really sets, without duplicated elements. Each edge appears
;;    only once in the edge list; i.e. an edge from a node x to another node
;;    y is represented as e(x,y), the term e(y,x) is not present. The
;;    graph-term form is our default representation. In SWI-Prolog there are
;;    predefined predicates to work with sets.
;;
;;    A third representation method is to associate with each node the set of
;;    nodes that are adjacent to that node. We call this the adjacency-list
;;    form. In our example:
;; [n(b,[c,f]), n(c,[b,f]), n(d,[]), n(f,[b,c,k]), ...]
;;
;;    The representations we introduced so far are Prolog terms and therefore
;;    well suited for automated processing, but their syntax is not very
;;    user-friendly. Typing the terms by hand is cumbersome and error-prone.
;;    We can define a more compact and "human-friendly" notation as follows:
;;    A graph is represented by a list of atoms and terms of the type X-Y
;;    (i.e. functor '-' and arity 2). The atoms stand for isolated nodes, the
;;    X-Y terms describe edges. If an X appears as an endpoint of an edge, it
;;    is automatically defined as a node. Our example could be written as:
;; [b-c, f-c, g-h, d, f-b, k-f, h-g]
;;
;;    We call this the human-friendly form. As the example shows, the list
;;    does not have to be sorted and may even contain the same edge multiple
;;    times. Notice the isolated node d. (Actually, isolated nodes do not
;;    even have to be atoms in the Prolog sense, they can be compound terms,
;;    as in d(3.75,blue) instead of d in the example).
;;
;;    [graph2.gif] When the edges are directed we call them arcs. These are
;;    represented by ordered pairs. Such a graph is called directed graph. To
;;    represent a directed graph, the forms discussed above are slightly
;;    modified. The example graph opposite is represented as follows:
;;
;;    Arc-clause form
;;           arc(s,u).
;;           arc(u,r).
;;           ...
;;
;;    Graph-term form
;;           digraph([r,s,t,u,v],[a(s,r),a(s,u),a(u,r),a(u,s),a(v,u)])
;;
;;    Adjacency-list form
;;           [n(r,[]),n(s,[r,u]),n(t,[]),n(u,[r]),n(v,[u])]
;;           Note that the adjacency-list does not have the information on
;;           whether it is a graph or a digraph.
;;
;;    Human-friendly form
;;           [s > r, t, u > r, s > u, u > s, v > u]
;;
;;    Finally, graphs and digraphs may have additional information attached
;;    to nodes and edges (arcs). For the nodes, this is no problem, as we can
;;    easily replace the single character identifiers with arbitrary compound
;;    terms, such as city('London',4711). On the other hand, for edges we
;;    have to extend our notation. Graphs with additional information
;;    attached to edges are called labelled graphs.
;;
;;    [graph3.gif]
;;
;;    Arc-clause form
;;           arc(m,q,7).
;;           arc(p,q,9).
;;           arc(p,m,5).
;;
;;    Graph-term form
;;           digraph([k,m,p,q],[a(m,p,7),a(p,m,5),a(p,q,9)])
;;
;;    Adjacency-list form
;;           [n(k,[]),n(m,[q/7]),n(p,[m/5,q/9]),n(q,[])]
;;           Notice how the edge information has been packed into a term with
;;           functor '/' and arity 2, together with the corresponding node.
;;
;;    Human-friendly form
;;           [p>q/9, m>q/7, k, p>m/5]
;;
;;    The notation for labelled graphs can also be used for so-called
;;    multi-graphs, where more than one edge (or arc) are allowed between two
;;    given nodes.
;;
;;    [77]P80 (***) Conversions
;;           Write predicates to convert between the different graph
;;           representations. With these predicates, all representations are
;;           equivalent; i.e. for the following problems you can always pick
;;           freely the most convenient form. The reason this problem is
;;           rated (***) is not because it's particularly difficult, but
;;           because it's a lot of work to deal with all the special cases.
;;

;;           Write a predicate path(G,A,B,P) to find an acyclic path P from

;;

;;           This is a classical problem in computer science. The objective

;;           are attacking each other; i.e., no two queens are in the same

;;           Hint: Represent the positions of the queens as a list of numbers
;;           1..N. Example: [4,2,7,3,6,8,5,1] means that the queen in the

;;
;;           [p92a.gif] [p92b.gif]
;;
;;           Anyway the puzzle goes like this: Given a tree with N nodes (and
;;           hence N-1 edges). Find a way to enumerate the nodes from 1 to N
;;           and, accordingly, the edges from 1 to N-1 in such a way, that
;;           for each edge K the difference of its node numbers equals to K.
;;           The conjecture is that this is always possible.
;;
;;           For small trees the problem is easy to solve by hand. However,
;;           for larger trees, and 14 is already very large, it is extremely
;;           difficult to find a solution. And remember, we don't know for

;;           this example, e.g. 25 x 20, and apparently always have unique
;;           solutions.
;;
;;    [101]P99 (***) Crossword puzzle
;;           Given an empty (or almost empty) framework of a crossword puzzle
;;           and a set of words. The problem is to place the words into the
;;           framework.
;;
;;           [p99.gif] The particular crossword puzzle is specified in a text
;;           file which first lists the words (one word per line) in an
;;           arbitrary order. Then, after an empty line, the crossword
;;           framework is defined. In this framework specification, an empty
;;           character location is represented by a dot (.). In order to make
;;           the solution easier, character locations can also contain
;;           predefined character values. The puzzle opposite is defined in
;;           the file [102]p99a.dat, other examples are [103]p99b.dat and
;;           [104]p99d.dat. There is also an example of a puzzle
;;           ([105]p99c.dat) which does not have a solution.
;;           Words are strings (character lists) of at least two characters.
;;           A horizontal or vertical sequence of character places in the
;;           crossword puzzle framework is called a site. Our problem is to
;;           find a compatible way of placing words onto sites.
;;           Hints: (1) The problem is not easy. You will need some time to
;;           thoroughly understand it. So, don't give up too early! And
;;           remember that the objective is a clean solution, not just a
;;           quick-and-dirty hack!
;;           (2) Reading the data file is a tricky problem for which a
;;           solution is provided in the file [106]p99-readfile.lisp. Use the
;;           predicate read_lines/2.
;;           (3) For efficiency reasons it is important, at least for larger
;;           puzzles, to sort the words and the sites in a particular order.
;;           For this part of the problem, the solution of [107]P28 may be
;;           very helpful.
